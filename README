This server package needs the following pip command on Python 3.6:
"sudo python3.6 -m pip install backports-datetime-fromisoformat"

In order to launch, open two tmux sessions.

In the first tmux session, use Python 3.6 to run the goal scoring portion of the bot:
python3.6 ./bot.py

If reloading the bot after a crash, instead of the above command, use:
python3.6 ./bot.py --reload

Then type, Ctrl-B and D to detach from the tmux session.

In the second tmux session, use Python 3.6 to launch the bot command line and AI:
python3.6 ./ai.py --console --send-to-discord


For development:

- See nhl_gamebreak_lib.py for more information and available library routines for NHL GameBreak Bot.
- In order to create custom get functions, create a script called "get_<insert intended get command here>.py" in the same folder as the "ai.py" file.
   - In this file, define an entry point method called "exec_get_func(client = discord.Client(), param = None)" and return a string which will be sent as a message/reply to Discord. This method will be executed from "ai.py".
   - The get command name is determined by the filename you chose above for the get command Python script.

       
Please excuse the ugly code, this was previously meant for my eyes only. Will clean it up soon.
